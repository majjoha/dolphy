- Handle file paths better for template engines:
  - The #erb and #haml methods currently don't take the view_path into
  consideration, only #render does. You can specify a view_path as the last
  argument for both methods, but this is not convenient in any way.

- Enable users to set the default content type for responses via the settings
  hash.
