# dolphy
Dolphy is an incredibly small web framework written in Ruby. It mimics the
behavior of Sinatra, and it is solely written for the purpose of learning how
Rack works. Its purpose is not to fight production-ready frameworks like
Sinatra, Ruby on Rails and friends.

There are a lot of things I want to do to improve the code and functionality of
this project. Many of these things can be found in the TODO file in the home
directory.
